📌 Word2Vec for Call & Phone Accessories Dataset
📖 Project Overview
This project implements Word2Vec, a powerful word embedding technique, to analyze and generate vector representations of words related to call and phone accessories. The model helps in understanding word relationships, similarities, and contextual meanings within this domain.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

gensim (for Word2Vec)

NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)

Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of textual data related to call and phone accessories, including product descriptions, customer reviews, and specifications.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Training a Word2Vec model to learn word embeddings

Visualizing word similarities using t-SNE

Finding most similar words to a given keyword

🔧 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Word2Vec-Project.git
cd Word2Vec-Project
Install dependencies:

bash

📈 Example Usage
python
Copy
Edit
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
model = Word2Vec.load("word2vec.model")
print(model.wv.most_similar("charger"))
📌 Results
Words like "charger", "adapter", and "powerbank" are closely related in vector space.

The model helps in product recommendation and semantic search.
